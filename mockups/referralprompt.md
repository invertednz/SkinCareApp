Use this prompt template to implement viral sharing + referral rewards in any mobile app.

---

## 📋 PROMPT TEMPLATE

```
As the world's best marketer and UX designer, implement a comprehensive viral sharing + referral rewards system for [APP_NAME] with the following specifications:

### CONTEXT
- **App Type**: skin care
- **Platform**: android and ios
- **Tech Stack**: flutter
- **Current User Flow**: we want this when the user has been given their special gift/offer

### CORE REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. Referral System Architecture
Create a complete referral tracking system including:
- **Referral Model**: Unique codes, success tracking, earned rewards
- **Referral Provider/Manager**: State management for referral data
- **Code Generation**: 8-character alphanumeric codes (avoid confusing chars like O/0, I/1)
- **Reward Tracking**: Track referrals, calculate rewards, enforce limits
- **Persistence**: Store in database (Supabase/Firebase/etc.)

#### 2. Viral Share Message Design
Craft a share message that includes:
- **Personal Story**: Make it sound authentic, not corporate
- **Specific Value Props**: Concrete benefits (numbers, features, outcomes)
- **Social Proof**: Reference the "gifter" or existing community
- **Clear CTA**: Simple action with referral code
- **Platform Optimization**: Works well on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, SMS, Email
- **Hashtags**: 2-3 relevant, searchable hashtags
- **Emojis**: Strategic use (not excessive) for visual appeal

**Template Structure**:
```
[Emoji] [Personal Hook about receiving value]

[Explain the value/benefit received in 1-2 sentences]

[Explain the unique mechanism - e.g., matched donation, group discount, etc.]

[Brief description of what the app does]

[CTA with referral code]

[Hashtags]
```

#### 3. Rewards Display UI
Design a compelling rewards tracker that shows:
- **Big Number Display**: Earned reward amount (large, bold, colorful)
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress toward max reward
- **Referral Count**: Number of successful referrals
- **Referral Code**: Prominently displayed, easy to copy
- **Next Milestone**: "X more referrals to earn $Y!"
- **Max Cap Messaging**: Clear limit to create urgency

**Design Principles**:
- Green gradient (success/growth colors)
- Trophy/reward iconography
- White cards with soft shadows
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Celebratory micro-animations (optional but powerful)

#### 4. Share Button & Placement
Implement native sharing with:
- **Platform Integration**: Use `share_plus` (Flutter), `Share` API (React Native), UIActivityViewController (iOS), ShareSheet (Android)
- **Strategic Placement**: Right after value is received (peak gratitude moment)
- **Compelling CTA**: "Share Your Gift", "Help Other [Users]", "Spread the Word"
- **Visual Design**: Outlined button (secondary CTA), warm colors, share icon
- **Context Box**: Yellow/gold gradient explaining why sharing matters

#### 5. Psychological Triggers to Implement
- ✅ **Reciprocity**: Frame sharing as "thank you" for gift/discount received
- ✅ **Social Proof**: Show community stats (e.g., "Join 10,000+ users")
- ✅ **Mission Alignment**: Connect sharing to noble cause
- ✅ **FOMO**: "Your friends might miss out"
- ✅ **Progress Gamification**: Visual progress, achievements, milestones
- ✅ **Status**: Leaderboards or "Top Referrer" badges (optional)

#### 6. Reward Structure
Define the economics:
- **Reward Per Referral**: $[AMOUNT] off next [PERIOD]
- **Max Reward Cap**: Maximum $[CAP] to prevent abuse
- **Redemption Timing**: When reward applies (next renewal, next purchase, etc.)
- **Stacking**: Can rewards stack or reset annually?
- **Alternative Rewards**: If not money (e.g., premium features, extra storage, bonus credits)

#### 7. Success Metrics to Track
Implement analytics for:
- Share button click rate
- Successful share completion rate
- Referral code usage rate
- Conversion rate (share → signup → paid)

- Time from share to conversion
- Reward redemption rate

## EXAMPLE: Fitness App

```
As the world's best marketer and UX designer, implement a comprehensive viral sharing + referral rewards system for FitTrack with the following specifications:

### CONTEXT
- **App Type**: Fitness & Nutrition Tracking
- **Platform**: Both iOS & Android
- **Tech Stack**: Flutter
- **Current User Flow**: After user completes their first 7-day streak

### Share Message Example:
```
💪 I just completed my first week on FitTrack and I'm already down 3 lbs!

A friend shared their "Workout Buddy" code with me and we both got $15 off our premium plans. Now we keep each other accountable!

FitTrack's AI creates custom workout plans, tracks nutrition, and sends motivation when you need it. Way better than hiring a $100/hr personal trainer!

Join me! Use my code: FIT8XK2P to get started 🚀

#FitnessGoals #HealthyLiving #FitTrack
```

### Rewards Structure:
- $15 off next year for each referral
- Max cap: $99 (full year free if you refer 7 friends)
- Redemption: Applied automatically at next renewal
```

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

A well-implemented viral sharing system should achieve:

- **20-40% share rate** among users who received value
- **5-15% conversion rate** from shares to signups
- **Viral coefficient of 0.4-1.0+** (sustainable growth)
- **50%+ reward redemption rate** (users actually come back)
- **Lower CAC** than paid acquisition channels
- **Higher LTV** for referred users (better quality, stickier)

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW

1. **Authentic over Corporate**: Message should sound like a friend texting, not a brand advertising
2. **Value-First**: Lead with benefit received, not app features
3. **Specific Numbers**: Concrete results (saved $X, achieved Y, helped Z parents)
4. **Low Friction**: One tap to share, code auto-included
5. **Immediate Gratification**: Show reward earned instantly
6. **Visual Progress**: Humans love seeing bars fill up
7. **Mission-Driven**: Connect to larger purpose (helping community, access for all, etc.)

---

❌ Generic "Share this app" button  
❌ No reward or unclear reward  
❌ Complicated multi-step sharing process  
❌ Corporate-sounding share message  
❌ No tracking or attribution  
❌ Hidden referral code or too small  
❌ Reward that's too small to motivate  
❌ Placing share button in wrong location (not at gratitude peak)  
❌ No visual feedback after sharing  
❌ Ignoring the "why" (just asks to share without explaining mission)

## FINAL NOTES

This viral sharing system works because it:
1. **Creates reciprocity** (they got value, now they share)
2. **Rewards both parties** (win-win)
3. **Feels authentic** (friend recommendation, not ad)
4. **Builds community** (movement of people helping each other)
5. **Gamifies growth** (progress bars, achievements, rewards)
6. **Aligns with mission** (e.g., "access for all parents")

The key is making users feel like **advocates for a mission**, not just unpaid marketers.
