# PRDs Index

This folder contains the PRDs for the Skincare App. Each PRD follows the `create-prd.md` structure and is aligned with the confirmed MVP scope.

- `prd-auth.md`
- `prd-onboarding.md`
- `prd-payment.md`
- `prd-diary-logging.md`
- `prd-insights.md`
- `prd-ai-chat.md`
- `prd-photo-capture-analysis.md`
- `prd-navigation-and-shell.md`
- `prd-notifications.md`
- `prd-analytics-and-privacy.md`

Next steps: review each PRD, confirm open questions, and then proceed to schema design and implementation tasks.
