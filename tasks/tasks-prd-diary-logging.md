### Notes

- Enforce up to 3 photos per entry, 10MB max each, 4096px max dimension.
- Current codebase: core diary UIs and diary repository remain pending. Photo upload pipeline is implemented via `PhotoUploadController` and `PhotoRepository`; leave core logging tasks unchecked until implemented.
- Photo pipeline enforces limits (max 3 photos per entry via `PhotoRepository.countForEntry`, 10MB, 4096px), strips EXIF, and performs JPEG re-encode with downscale.
- Uploads go to Supabase Storage bucket `user-photos`; metadata persisted in `photos` table (`user_id`, `entry_id`, `path`, `width`, `height`, `bytes`).
- Retries with exponential backoff and cancel UI are implemented; snackbars surface success/error.
